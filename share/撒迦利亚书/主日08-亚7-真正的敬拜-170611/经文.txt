谴责不诚恳的禁食
1大流士王第四年九月，就是基斯流月初四日，耶和华的话临到撒迦利亚。2那时伯特利人已经打发沙利色和利坚米勒，并跟从他们的人，去恳求耶和华的恩，3并问万军之耶和华殿中的祭司和先知说：“我历年以来，在五月间哭泣斋戒，现在还当这样行吗？”4万军之耶和华的话就临到我说：5“你要宣告国内的众民和祭司，说：‘你们这七十年在五月、七月禁食悲哀，岂是丝毫向我禁食吗？6你们吃喝，不是为自己吃、为自己喝吗？7当耶路撒冷和四围的城邑有居民，正兴盛，南地高原有人居住的时候，耶和华藉从前的先知所宣告的话，你们不当听吗？’”

被掳的原因
8耶和华的话又临到撒迦利亚说：9“万军之耶和华曾对你们的列祖如此说：‘要按至理判断，各人以慈爱怜悯弟兄。10不可欺压寡妇、孤儿、寄居的和贫穷人，谁都不可心里谋害弟兄。’11他们却不肯听从，扭转肩头，塞耳不听，12使心硬如金钢石，不听律法和万军之耶和华用灵藉从前的先知所说的话。故此，万军之耶和华大发烈怒。13万军之耶和华说：我曾呼唤他们，他们不听；将来他们呼求我，我也不听。14我必以旋风吹散他们到素不认识的万国中。这样，他们的地就荒凉，甚至无人来往经过，因为他们使美好之地荒凉了。”

1In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourthday of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
2Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,
3speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?"
4Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
5"Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?
6'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?
7'Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'"
8Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,
9"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;
10and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.'
11"But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.
12"They made their heartslike flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
13"And justc as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;
14"but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate."

禁食问题
1大利乌王第四年九月，就是基斯流月初四日，耶和华的话临到撒迦利亚。2那时，伯特利人差派了沙利色、利坚米勒和他的随从，去恳求耶和华施恩。3他们询问万军之耶和华殿里的众祭司，以及众先知说：“我们还要在五月哭泣和禁食，像我们这许多年来所行的吗？”

4万军之耶和华的话临到我，说：5“你要告诉这地的人民和祭司说：‘这七十年来，你们在五月和七月禁食哀哭，岂是真的为我禁食呢？6你们吃，你们喝，岂不是为你们自己吃，为你们自己喝吗？7这些话耶和华不是曾借着从前的先知宣告了吗？那时，耶路撒冷和四围的城镇都有人居住，很是兴旺，南地和高地都有人居住。’”

被掳是因为悖逆　神
8耶和华的话又临到撒迦利亚说：9“万军之耶和华曾这样告诉你们的列祖说：‘你们要执法公正，各人要以慈爱和怜悯待自己的兄弟。10寡妇、孤儿、寄居的和贫穷人，你们都不可欺压，也不可各自心里图谋恶事，陷害自己的兄弟。’11但他们不肯听从，反而硬着颈项，充耳不闻（“反而硬着颈项，充耳不闻”直译作“转着固执的肩膊，使自己的耳朵发沉不听”）。12他们使自己的心刚硬如金钢石，不肯听从律法和万军之耶和华借着他的灵、透过从前的先知所说的话。因此，万军之耶和华非常忿怒。13我曾呼唤他们，他们不听；照样，将来他们呼求我，我也不听。这是万军之耶和华说的。14我用旋风把他们吹散到他们不认识的列国去，他们留下的地就荒凉了，以致无人来往经过，因为他们使这美好之地变为荒凉了。”
